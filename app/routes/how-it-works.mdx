# How it works

Rate Your Boss is a Chrome extension that kicks in when you're browsing a Linkedin profile.

You'll want to pin it to your browser bar. Click the "Extensions" icon on Chrome and "Pin" `Rate Your Boss`.

With your extension installed, start browsing [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/). If a person hasn't received any feedback yet, you'll see a `+` sign.

Otherwise you'll see the average recommendation score.

Clicking on the icon will either take you to the `Manager feedback` page (if there's any feedback to see) or the `New feedback` page.

You log in via `Linkedin Auth` to protect managers from spam, but **we don't store your personal information**! [Check the code, it's open source](https://github.com/rate-your-boss/rate-your-boss).

The form you compile is based on [Google's Manager Feedback Survey](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-give-feedback-to-managers/steps/introduction/).

Once submitted, the feedback is immediately visible on the manager's page. This page is publicly visible, so it can be shared with your manager and other employees.
