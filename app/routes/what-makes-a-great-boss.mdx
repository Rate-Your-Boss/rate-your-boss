# What makes a great boss

There are four areas where a great boss excels.

1. [Caring](#caring)
2. [Coaching](#coaching)
3. [Leadership](#leadership)
4. [Effectiveness](#effectiveness)

### <a id="caring" href="#caring">Caring</a>

> The first dimension is about being more than 'just professional.' It's about giving a damn, sharing more than just your work self, and encouraging everyone who reports to you to do the same.[...] It's not just business; it is personal, and deeply personal. I call this dimension 'Care Personally.' — Kim Scott, [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)

In many ways, caring about the people that work with you is the necessary condition for everything else you do as a boss.

Google teaches managers that caring for the the personal well-being of their teams is a critical behavior of successful managers. But it's not enough for a manager to simply care about their team members as people. In the research, the Google team learned that employees value how their managers show their consideration and support. Managers need to show and communicate their care back to employees.

### <a id="coaching" href="#coaching">Coaching</a>

> When leaders operate as challengers, telling less and asking more, they get contributions from their people that far surpass what they thought they had to give and it is this concomitant exhilaration that makes people sign up again and again. Why? Because they have been offered a deeply challenging and rewarding experience. — Liz Wiseman, [Multipliers](https://thewisemangroup.com/books/multipliers/)

People do their best and most fullfilling work under great coaches and challengers, because these leaders know how to stretch their capabilities allow them to grow.

Google's manager research revealed that one of the most important behaviors of the highest scoring managers was that they were effective coaches. This is seen in other professions, as well. For example, in sports, many former athletes can tell stories about how a coach changed their life by identifying strengths, unlocking their potential, and encouraging them to persevere.

### <a id="leadership" href="#leadership">Leadership</a>

> Leadership requires two things: a vision of the world that does not yet exist and the ability to communicate it. — Simon Sinek, [Start With Why](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/)

Inspiring and motivating people might not require much more than connecting what people do with a bigger picture, to effectively communicate why what they do matters. While simple in practice, it's not necessarily an easy thing to do.

Google's manager research found that setting a vision is an important behavior of high-scoring managers. These managers are also clear, concise, and honest in their verbal and written communications.

### <a id="effectiveness" href="#effectiveness">Effectiveness</a>

> Look for ways to make quick progress. Watch for project stalls that might indicate a lack of potential. Cut corners to skip unnecessary effort. Remove distractions to focus attention where it needs to be. Start approximating your end goal as soon as possible. Maximize the impact of your most difficult effort. — Ken Kocienda, [Creative Selection](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250194466/creativeselection)

This is your main responsibility as a leader: driving results. Ultimately nothing else you do matters if your team or your organisation doesn't accomplish its goals.

Google's research has found that effective managers focus on empowering their teams to deliver concrete results. They combine a focus on urgency with an understanding of what results will have the most impact. The most effective managers realize that they work for their teams and not the other way around.
