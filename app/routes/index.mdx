# You deserve a <strong className="text-indigo-600">great boss</strong>

Chances are, you're not working with a great boss at the moment.

- [One in two employees have left a job to get away from their manager](https://www.gallup.com/services/182216/state-american-manager-report.aspx)

This has got to change.

How about removing managers altogether?

Google tried that before: probably the biggest experiment in the world.

[It didn't work](https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/managers/). **Managers matter**.

If anything, the experiment proved that working with an inspiring leader can be an extremely fulfilling experience.

> Great bosses use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, light bulbs go off over people's heads; ideas flow and problems get solved. â€” Liz Wiseman, Multipliers

This should be the norm. Companies that are ignoring this are wasting [billions of dollars](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231593/why-great-managers-rare.aspx).

We've been inpired by Google's research and books like [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/), [Multipliers](https://thewisemangroup.com/books/multipliers/), and [Crucial Conversations](https://cruciallearning.com/crucial-conversations-book/) and we built a tool that makes it easy to give actionable feedback to your managers, so they know where to improve.

## Our principles

1. **Feedback should be a gift**. <br /> We believe that managers that understand their strengths and weaknesses have the best chance to grow as leaders.
1. **Feedback should be anonymous**. <br /> We believe employees should be given a safe space to voice their opinions.
1. **Feedback should be public**. <br /> We believe perspective employees should be able to choose a boss that plays to their strengths.
