## Local development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

You also need the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli) and have created a database with a dev branch.

Make a copy of `.env.example` in `.env` and add the required variables.

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go.
